## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
How might we create a personalized platform that connects individuals with industry mentors from diverse companies, fostering meaningful relationships and career growth while addressing the barriers of accessibility, relevance, and inclusivity in professional mentorship?

Project Description 🤯
This project is a personalized mentorship platform that connects users with industry professionals based on their interests, career goals, and skill development needs. Users create a profile detailing their background, aspirations, and preferences, and the platform’s algorithm matches them with mentors from diverse companies and industries. Through the app, users can schedule mentorship sessions, track their progress, and access tools and resources for professional growth in a supportive and inclusive environment. 

## Project Value 💰
The target customer is students, recent graduates, and professionals seeking career guidance and meaningful mentorship to navigate their industries. These users often struggle to find accessible and personalized mentorship opportunities through traditional platforms like LinkedIn or workplace networks. The app provides tangible benefits, including tailored mentor matches, a streamlined way to build professional relationships, and tools to track career progress, ultimately empowering users to achieve their goals with confidence and clarity.
