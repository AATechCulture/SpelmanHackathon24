I hear you're interested in technology! What area excites you the most?
I’m into coding and mobile app development but still figuring out what suits me best.
That’s a great start! Since you’re working with Python, you could explore AI or data science, or stick with web development if you enjoy creating user experiences. Use websites like Figma to explore user design. Don’t worry about the math for AI—tools like TensorFlow make it easier.
Also, join tech communities and upload your projects to GitHub to build a portfolio.
Thanks for the advice! I’ll start using GitHub and keep learning.
